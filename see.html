						<h4 id=#sites>Culture and Tradition</h4>
						<p>Tokyo is modern city that is steeped in tradition and culture. The embrace of modern culture is done in such a way that tradition and old Tokyo will never be out of site or left behind. These are a few of my favorite temples and shrines around Tokyo. They may or may not be listed in order by my favorites.  They're all great.  if not, they wouldn't be on the list!</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Meiji-jingu Shrine in Harajuku</li>
						<li>Tenno-ji Temple in Yanaka overlooks Tenno-ji Cemetary.  It's just around the corner from Nippori Station.</li>
						<li>Hie Jinja Shrine is nestled between government buildings and the business district of Asakasa on a hilltop</li>
						<li>Asakusa-jinja Shrine in Asakusa.  It's near the very popular Senso-ji Temple, so you may miss it.</li>
						<li>Senso-ji Temple in Asakusa is considered the spiritual heart of Tokyo.</li>

						<p>Get up early, make sure you're wearing comfortable shoes and enjoy!</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Start at Harajuki Station</li>

						<li>Join the throngs of people along this narrow street and check out all of the shops.</li>
